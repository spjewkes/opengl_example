# OpenGL example

This is a simple example of OpenGL based on the tutorial from http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/

Future plans to improve this code:
* Improve compiler build settings
* Make code cross platform (only builds for Mac OS X currently)
* Possibly get rid of GLM dependency
* Allow the user to change the spinning of the cube
* Allow the display of other models
