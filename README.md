# OpenGL example

This is a simple example of OpenGL based on the tutorial from http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/

Future plans to improve this code:
* Make code cross platform (only builds for Mac OS X currently)
* Possibly get rid of GLM dependency
* Allow the display of other models

To set up on the Mac OS X you can use brew to install the following:
* brew install glew
* brew install glfw
* brew install glm

To set up on Linux you will need to install the following:
* sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
* sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
* sudo apt-get install libglm-dev
* sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
